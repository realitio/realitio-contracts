/*
This contract extends the standard Arbitrator contract to make it possible to make routine fund withdrawals to an address pre-registered by the owner without actually being the owner.

We do this to facilitate controlling Arbitrator contracts using multisig wallets, which should require multiple sign-offs to allow validation and fee-settings tasks, but users should be able to withdraw their own share of the funds without anyone else's permission. This can be done in combination with our SplitterWallet contract.
